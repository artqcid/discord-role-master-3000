# Discord Role Master 3000 - Model Context Protocol

This file configures the Agent's behavior and context awareness for the Discord Role Master 3000 project.

## 🚨 MANDATORY CONTEXT
**BEFORE EVERY ACTION**, the Agent MUST consult the following files in `.context/`:

1.  **`project_plan.md`** (The Bible):
    -   Contains the **current project status** and **active task list**.
    -   Agent MUST check off tasks here as they are completed.
2.  **`AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`** ( The Law):
    -   Contains **coding standards (CCD)**, **naming conventions**, and **QA checklists**.
    -   Agent MUST follow these rules strictly.
3.  **`architecture.md`** (The Map):
    -   Contains **folder structure**, **layer boundaries**, and **forbidden imports**.
    -   Agent MUST NOT violate these constraints.

## 🧠 KNOWLEDGE BASE (Reference as needed)
-   `tech_stack.md`: Precise library versions and setup commands.
-   `data_model.md`: Database schema and relationships.
-   `api_reference.md`: API endpoints, request/response formats.
-   `discord_permissions.md`: Domain logic for Discord permissions.

## ⚡ WORKFLOW RULES
1.  **Thinking Process**:
    -   Acknowledge the current task from `project_plan.md`.
    -   Verify the architectural constraints in `architecture.md`.
    -   Plan the implementation according to `AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` (CCD).
2.  **Implementation**:
    -   Write clean, modular code.
    -   Adhere to strict **file size limits** (300 lines) and **function size limits** (30 lines).
    -   Use **Pydantic schemas** for all data exchange.
3.  **Documentation**:
    -   Update `.context/` files immediately if the code changes divergent from the plan.


## 🛑 AUTO-REFUSAL
The Agent shall **REFUSE** to:
-   Write code without first explaining the plan.
-   Implement features not in the active task list (YAGNI).
-   Violate the layer architecture (e.g., SQL in Routers).
